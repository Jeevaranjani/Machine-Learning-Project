From that code I import the csv file for covid-19 patients.some of the library that I have been used there are pandas,numpy,matplotlib,seaborn.
I'm finding the missing values of that data and remomed the missing values of that data .
Preprocess the data by using various plots like histogram,box plot.
Feature extraction and scaling.
Train and Test the model For model implementation used sklearn library file.
Used logistic regression Used confusion matrix and f-measure.
Whether the datas are balanced equally.
Used undersampling to balance the data Again used logistic regression,decision tree,random forest and SVM.
Then checked the accuracy of those models.
